At 828 metres (2,716.5 ft), the 200 plus storey Burj Khalifa has 160 habitable levels, the most of any building in the world. The tower was inaugurated on January 4, 2010, and is responsible for a number of world-firsts. The tower became the world’s tallest man-made structure just 1,325 days after excavation work started in January 2004. Burj Khalifa utilised a record-breaking 330,000 cubic metres of concrete; 39,000 tonnes of steel reinforcement; 103,000 square metres of glass; and 15,500 square metres of embossed stainless steel. The tower took 22 million man hours to build.",

        "desc": "For an out-of-this-world adventure, look no further than the Atacama Desert in western Chile. With jagged ravines, billowing geysers and arid salt flats, there’s an extra-terrestrial quality to its landscapes that NASA once harnessed to field test Martian rovers. As one of the driest places on the planet, there’s very little in the way of human development surrounding its barren plains. That said, the resulting lack of light pollution makes the sky perfect for stargazing.",

Built in 800AD by the indigenous Tayrona tribes, it was abandoned following a run-in with Spanish conquistadors and largely forgotten, until looters rediscovered it in the 1970s. You’ll need to make like Indiana Jones if you want to see it for yourself, as the high-altitude trek up involves a three-day trudge through humid cloudforest.",

The unique wildlife here has evolved to be fearless, stemming from the lack of predators on the volcanic isles, so you can easily snorkel with marine iguanas or share the rocky outcrops with groups of giant tortoises. The islands have recently become more popular, but strict controls on tourists mean the human footprint is kept to a minimum.",

There are around a thousand living here in the lowland forests, including the habituated Mimikere or ‘M’ group. But reaching them is no easy task: the journey involves a steep and strenuous climb through dense vegetation. As Tanzania’s most remote national park, Mahale Mountains has no roads and is only reachable by boat or chartered flight.",
